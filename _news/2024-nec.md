Very happy about being awarded the Raja Parasuraman: Young Investigator Award sponsored by BIONIC at [Neuroergonomics 2024](http://neuroergonomics2024.inria.fr) conference for the paper “Agency-preserving action augmentation: towards preemptive muscle control using brain-computer interfaces“. The paper, which I wrote with Leonie Terfurth and Klaus Gramann should be out on biorXiv very soon!
