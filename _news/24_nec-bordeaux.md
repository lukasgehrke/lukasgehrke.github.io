Neuroergonomics conference in Bordeaux was good fun and came with a surprise. I was awarded the [Raja Parasuraman: Young Investigator Award sponsored by BIONIC](https://neuroergonomics2024.inria.fr/awards/) at [Neuroergonomics 2024](http://neuroergonomics2024.inria.fr) conference for the paper “Agency-preserving action augmentation: towards preemptive muscle control using brain-computer interfaces“. The paper, which I wrote with Leonie Terfurth and Klaus Gramann is on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16896) now!
