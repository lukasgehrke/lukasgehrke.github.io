I now published the data we reported on in two earlier two publications at [CHI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3290605.3300657) and in [JNE](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ac69bc/meta). The data is available on [openneuro](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003846/versions/2.0.2) and the detailed specification can now be found in [Frontiers in Neuroergonomics](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroergonomics/articles/10.3389/fnrgo.2024.1411305/full).
